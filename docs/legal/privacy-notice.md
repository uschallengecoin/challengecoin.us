We may combine information from third parties with information we have collected from you and your use of the Platform.

**3. Information We Collect Automatically**

We collect information related to your use of the Platform and the devices you use to access those Platform.

**Cookies and Similar Technologies**

We use "cookies" and similar tools to track your use of this Website when you use our Platform. We collect information such as the types of service used, and number of users we receive daily. Our web servers automatically log information about your computer, but we do not use this information to identify you personally.

We and our vendors use cookies and similar technologies to improve our Platform, our Website and to provide more convenient and relevant experiences to you. Cookies are designed to transfer a small amount of data to your browser by servers within a domain. That data is only read by designated servers within that domain. It functions as your computer's identification card and enables WebdevelopPRO to improve your experience by securely maintaining your authenticated session and preferences.

A web beacon embeds a small transparent gif image in a web page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. A similar device may be used where a product, service or functionality sends data to a server when a set of user-initiated events occur such as clicking a button on the Website or in an email. This is similar to a cookie – it tracks your visit and the data is only read by the server that receives the data. However, it differs because it is not browser-based, may not function as an ID card and does not store any data on your computer.

Most Internet browsers are set up to accept cookies automatically. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, allowing you to decide whether or not to accept it. For some web pages requiring an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices will probably not be able to access those pages or their services. Please see our [[cookie|Cookie Policy]] for more information.

**USE OF INFORMATION**

WebdevelopPRO uses information collected for the purpose of providing the Services. We will process and transfer information within and to the US and other countries from which WebdevelopPRO or its authorized third parties may operate, which may have different privacy laws from your country of residence.
