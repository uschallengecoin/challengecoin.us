### Personal information requests

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may request the following in relation to your personal information:

- **Information** about how we have collected and used personal information. We have made this information available to you without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.

You may also designate an authorized agent to submit personal information requests on your behalf. We will require authorized agents to confirm their identity and authority, in accordance with applicable law.

In some instances, your choices may be limited, such as where fulfilling your request would impair the rights of others, our ability to provide a service you have requested, or our ability to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our legal rights. The rights described above are not available in connection with personal information we have collected, used, or disclosed about consumers who apply for financial products or services for personal, family, or household purposes. Such information is subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or state financial privacy laws. For more information about your choices regarding this information, see our GLBA Privacy Notice at the end of this Privacy Policy.

### Do Not Track

Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/)

## Payment processors

When you engage in a financial transaction, you direct us to share certain information with these payment processors, and you will provide other information—such as your credit card or bank account information—directly to them. We do not record or maintain this financial information. For more information on how transactions are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy practices of these payment processors, please refer to the privacy notices of [Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com/), [Plaid](https://www.plaid.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

## Other sites, mobile applications and services

Our services may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and mobile applications and online services you use.

## Security practices

We use organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, loss, disclosure, alteration and destruction of personal information we maintain. Unfortunately, data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed as completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information.
