### Giving Back
American’s help one another. The ethos of dignified charity has been in our blood since the founding of our country. We’ve never forgotten the sacrifices that our service members, public safety professionals and first responders have made to protect our way of life and keep us safe from harm. Whether donating to a local cause or supporting a large-scale national initiative, **Americans have always taken care of their protectors and heroes**.
### Community-Driven
U.S. Challenge Coin unites America around those ideas that made our country the greatest in the world. Proceeds from the sale of every single coin are donated to causes that directly help American heroes in need. And every owner/collector of a U.S. Challenge Coin can join the U.S. Challenge Coin community to decide where future donation funds go by participating in our social media platform .  

Join the **first-ever challenge coin community for everyone who loves America**. By purchasing a U.S. Challenge Coin, powered by cutting-edge blockchain and crypto technologies, you automatically become a member of a nationwide community that doesn’t simply just care about our nation’s heroes, but one that proactively participates and gives back
