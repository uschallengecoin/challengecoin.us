U.S. Challenge Coin’s first partner charitable organization is the Tunnel to Towers Foundation (www.t2t.org) which honors firefighter Stephen Siller who laid down his life to save others on September 11, 2001, and our military and first responders who continue to make the supreme sacrifice of life and limb for our country. U.S. Challenge Coin will continue to add partner’s to its charity initiatives over time through the input given by our coin holders.
