### Receiving Means Giving
American’s help one another. The ethos of dignified charity has been in our blood since the founding of our country. We’ve never forgotten the sacrifices that our service members, public safety professionals and first responders have made to protect our way of life and keep us safe from harm. Whether donating to a local cause or supporting a large-scale national initiative, Americans have always taken care of their protectors and heroes.

### America’s Next Digital Revolution
We all know that crypto currencies and the digital Blockchain have been around for years and these technologies are here to stay and growing in popularity. But most Americans have been left on the sidelines watching this technological and financial revolution take place right in front of their eyes with no idea how to learn, participate and benefit from these massive developments.  Blockchain technology, the backbone of crypto and many other emerging applications, is changing the way that the world perceives value and how people interact and transact with financial systems and money.
### Buy a U.S. Challenge Coin, Get Free Crypto
U.S. Challenge Coin believes that these new technologies should be made available to all Americans. Which is why we are incorporating and deploying them into the U.S. Challenge Coin community to educate and onboard millions of everyday Americans into crypto. Every U.S. Challenge Coin minted will be recorded on the blockchain.  In other words: U.S. Challenge Coin is giving away free crypto to every coin buyer. Don’t know anything about crypto? No worries, we make it easy! Our U.S. Challenge Coin crypto token is a community token that lets you participate in our nationwide community and ecosystem of patriots and heroes.

### A Symbol of Honor for Every American

For over a century, challenge coins have represented unity, service, and valor. Now, you can own a piece of this legacy.

Challenge coins trace their roots back to the battlefields of World War I, where they were bestowed upon and carried by soldiers as a mark of identity, loyalty, and belonging. Today, they’ve evolved into powerful symbols of honor — exchanged among military units, first responders, and officials to recognize service and strengthen bonds.

**Now, as the United States prepares to celebrate 250 years of independence, the tradition lives on.**

The U.S. Challenge Coin was created to commemorate this milestone — a modern tribute to American resilience and pride. 100% made and designed in America in collaboration with renowned sculptor and engraver **Don Everhart II** (U.S. Mint / Franklin Mint) its beautiful design and timeless craftsmanship bridges past and present, honoring those who’ve served and inspiring those who collect and carry it.

Owning this coin means holding a piece of American history — a symbol of who we are, where we’ve been, and the legacy we carry forward.
