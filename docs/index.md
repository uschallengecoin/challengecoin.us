### A Symbol of Honor for Every American

For over a century, challenge coins have represented unity, service, and valor. Now, you can own a piece of this legacy and be part of history.

Challenge coins in America trace their roots back to the battlefields of World War I, where they were bestowed upon and carried by soldiers as a mark of identity, loyalty, and belonging. Today, they’ve evolved into powerful symbols of honor — exchanged among military units, first responders, and even businesses and organization to recognize service and strengthen bonds.

**Now, as the United States prepares to celebrate 250 years of independence, the tradition lives on.**

The U.S. Challenge Coin was created to commemorate this milestone — a modern tribute to American resilience and pride. 100% made and designed in the U.S. in collaboration with renowned sculptor and engraver <VDialogClickText name="engraver">**Don Everhart II (U.S. Mint / Franklin Mint)**</VDialogClickText> its beautiful design and timeless craftsmanship bridges past and present, honoring those who’ve served and inspiring those who collect and carry it.

Owning this coin means holding a piece of American history — a symbol of who we are, where we’ve been, and the legacy we carry forward.
